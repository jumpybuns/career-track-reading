QUAN OVER QUAL-
stick with a schedule because you need to mentally commit otherwise you cant improve. Just build whatever it is your building instead of hemming and hawing about whether its the right project for you.


CLEAN CODE CH1 -
clean code is hard work, it takes reading lots of code to get good at it.
Code is never going away, someone will always be neede to write clean code. Bad Code is messy and added haphazardly, rushed, tired of looking at it. This guy really hates messy code which is a good philosphy to adapt. Just because we can recognize clean code doesnt mean we can write it. Clean code should expose the tensios in the problem to be solved. It should give the reader an Aha moment. should make it easy for others to enhance it. 
-Run all tests -No duplication -Express all design ideas -minimize number of entities

RED GREEN REFACTOR - 
red-thing about what you want to develop
green-think about how to make your tests pass 
refractor-think about how to improve your existing implementation

CYCLES OF TDD - 
you must writea failing test before you write any production code.
you must not write more than a test thn is sufficient to fail
you must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass

rules of cycle - 
create a unit test that fails, write production code that makes that test pass, clean up the mess you just made

customers like the way a machine behaves and the ease in which it can be changed

refactor minute by minute

programmers make specific cases work by writing code that makes the general case work.
